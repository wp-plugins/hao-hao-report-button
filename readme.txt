You can enable and disable the button from the plugin's settings page, as well as set the position, location and styles of the button.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is the Hao Hao Report? =
The [Hao Hao Report](http://www.haohaoreport.com/ "The best China news and blog stories") (HHR) is a way to quickly see what the most popular English language articles regarding China are. The HHR accepts blog posts, major news articles, photos and basically anything about China.

You may have heard the term 'social bookmarking' before. Basically, social bookmarking allows people to save links to good articles or sites in a way that others can view them and perhaps add them to their bookmarks as well. The HHR is that plus some. If you're familiar with the popular Digg.com site, then you're familiar with the Hao Hao Report, as the principle is the same.

= My auto-populated summary text has some weird junk in it. What's up with that? =
The text for the summary is grabbed directly from the post's content. The plugin does the best it can to remove HTML code, etc., but if you are using other tags/short code in your posts, it may not be removed by the plugin's filters. To get around this, simply be sure to set an excerpt directly in the Excerpt box below the post editor -- this overrides the auto-generated excerpt.

= How can I customize the button's location/style? =
Simply use the plugin's setting page (SETTINGS->HHR BUTTON) in your WordPress administration area. From this page you:

* Enable/Disable the plugin - a good option if you want to maintain your settings, but want to stop the button from displaying.
* Set which pages the plugin should be displayed on. eg. only on full-length post pages, etc.
* Set whether the button appears at the top or the bottom of the content.
* Set the style of the button's container -- have it align to the left or the right of the content, or add your own CSS styles.
